To do: needs to be updated

Hello everyone!

This is the first attempt of building a website inside the Odin Project web development course.

I am gonna do a recipe list of my girlfriend's recipes.

I know from now that it is not gonna look that great, but I hope I will learn stuff and moving on with the course I will improve it and make it look better!
